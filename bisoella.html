        To get access to this waterfall, we have to travel in a narrow concrete road just opposite of the Panakaduwa School's name board. The waterfall is about 3Km away from the main road running from Pitabeddara to Pasgoda.
The narrow concrete road leading to the waterfall runs uphill. Travelling about two kilometers, you have to move downhill until you reach the car park. Moving at the top of the hill, you can hear plainly the thunder of the fall. As you move downhill little by little, you can hear the roaring sound of the fall. Stepping down along the flight of steps, you can see the Mother Nature’s magical creation.
The canopy of the branches of the trees on either side provides the shade and create a bit pleasant atmosphere. The patches of woods stretching far away create an artistic tableau in our mind. The location of the fall is so fantastic that it takes our breath away. A large volume of water tumble down a cliff into a deep pool at the base creating a smoke-like spray and making a roaring sound. The water droplets come thick and fast like a cloud of smoke and overrun our body giving us goose pimples. The water drops settled down on the leaves of the overhanging bushes glitter in the sun like the diamonds spread all over creating an amazingly stunning picture in our mind.
This is an ideal place for our mental relaxation and a resting place to admire a wonderful creation of the Mother Nature keeping the hustle and bustle of the city at the bay.
The best time to visit the fall is early hours in the morning or late hours in the evening. Although there is parking facilities there is no sanitary or refreshment facilities. It’s worth visiting this fall, but keep in mind to take care of the Nature., https://lk.asiafirms.com/matara/biso-ella-waterfall-1407824.html
