        2005-03-14 was the auspicious day when a branch of Mahamevnawa Bhavana Asapu was donated to Embilipitiya, Suriyawewa area, which was a very difficult rural area before, and has now become a very developed city. The people who lived in this village, which had been proselytized, became disciples of Gautama Buddha again after establishing this holy land. Built in a quiet environment full of rural beauty, the Suriyawewa Mahamevnawa meditation hermitage currently consists of 17 cottages for the devotees to live in, a large dharma hall, an alms hall and other temples. Also, more than 2000 devotees participate in monthly Seela meditation programs in Asapu. Built with the financial and labor sacrifices of many devotees, a 108-feet-tall King Chaitanya is also enshrined in Sarvajna relics and Arahant relics. Also, the Bodhi Mandapa of Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, where Ananda Bodhisattvas were escorted, is also currently under construction.    <div class="photo">
