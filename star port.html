        History <br>
        The Dutch who occupied several coastal parts of Sri Lanka after expelling the Portuguese gained control of the Matara Fort by the 17th century. In 1760 a rebellion took place at Matara mainly due to the Dutch endeavour to register peasants' holding of lands and
        either to dispossess or tax them if they couldn't prove title (De Silva, 1988). Sinhalese forces backed by the Kandyan Kingdom
        captured the Matara Fort in March 1761 and held it for a period of nearly one year (De Silva, 1988; Wikramaratne, 2015). The Dutch
        retook the fort in February 1762 and decided to erect the Star Fort on the western bank of the Nilwala Ganga River in order to
        strengthen their defences (De Silva, 1988; Wikramaratne, 2015).

        <br>
        The construction work of the Star Fort was begun in 1763 and completed in 1765 (Abeyawardana, 2004; Mandawala, 2012;
        Wikramaratne, 2015). A person named Orukema Muhandiram was in charge of this construction under the Dutch Governor Baron
        Van Eck (Mandawala, 2012; Wikramaratne, 2015). After the fort was built, it was used as barracks with the residential
        accommodation for the Commanding Officer.

        The fort <br>
        The fort has been built in the shape of a unique six-pointed star (Abeyawardana, 2004; De Silva, 1988; Wikramaratne, 2015). It is
        surrounded by a moat and a drawbridge with arches has been built at the main gate. Although the drawbridge no longer exists, the
        attractive gateway with the Dutch coat of arms is still well preserved (De Silva, 1 988; Mandawala, 2012). The moat had been filled
        with earth but was later excavated and preserved by the Department of Archaeology (Abeyawardana, 2004). After the main gate,
        there are two similar gates and two inner rooms (Wikramaratne, 2015). A deep well is found in the middle of the fort
        (Wikramaratne, 2015).

        The gate <br>
        The attractive arch-shaped entrance gate of Matara Star Fort is considered a splendid example of Dutch colonial architecture (De
        Silva, 1988). The semi-circular upper portion of it is ornamented with the VOC (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie. United East
        Indian Company) initials (De Silva, 1988; Wikramaratne, 2015). Below it is the name of the fort, Redoute van Eck (De Silva, 1988). A
        plaque with van Eck's coat of arms, flanked by two lions is found immediately below the fort name (De Silva, 1988). Also, the initials
        of van Eck (L.I.V.E.) and the year "1763" are denoted on the bottom of it (Wikramaratne, 2015).
