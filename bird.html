        The Bird Park at Hambantota boast of being the Asia’s largest Birds Park and Research Centre and is home to endemic and exotic birds with over 180 varieties and around 3200 birds. The park which is located in the Southern part of the island expands on a landscape of 35 acres and is dedicated to create awareness and interest in wild life and the Importance of Conservation of fauna and flora.

The park is divided in to 5 zones namely, Wetlands, Wings of Asia, Flightless Birds, Macaw and Cockatoos and Parrot Paradise.
<br>
Wetlands<br>
The Wetlands Exhibit at Birds Park aims to showcase the diverse bird life as well as create awareness of the importance of wetland ecosystems and how we can take action to protect them. Wetlands are vital for providing clean water to urban areas! They improve water quality by trapping harmful pollutants in sediment and absorbing excess nutrients.
<br>
Wings of Asia<br>
This area houses Asia’s most exotic and endangered birds, you can take a walk into this free flight aviary and admire one of the largest collections of Asian birds. The Aviary is a home to the critically endangered as well as endemic birds of Asia and Sri Lanka. In its efforts to conserve the species, off-exhibit aviaries were set up to breed these birds. Since the breeding programme started since inception of the park and through its research programme, the Park has successfully bred several of these rare birds.
<br>
Flightless Birds<br>
Flightless birds are birds that through evolution lost the ability to fly. There are many species to look at including the well known ratites such as the Ostrichs, Emus, and Rheas. The largest (both heaviest and tallest) flightless bird, which is also the largest living bird, is the Ostrich (2.7 m, 156 kg). Many domesticated birds, such as the domestic chicken and domestic duck, have lost the ability to fly for extended periods, although their ancestral species, the red junglefowl and mallard, respectively, are capable of extended flight. Flightlessness has evolved in many different birds independently.
<br>
Macaw & Cockatoo Zone<br>
Macaws and Cockatoos can be tamed and raised as pets without any serious injuries to humans. They have wonderful and complex personalities, great intelligence, live a long time, and are relatively easy to care for physically. They are extremely inquisitive, curious, affectionate, and playful animals that need a great deal of time and attention paid to them in order for them to be happy and well adjusted.
<br>
Parrot Paradise<br>
Birds Park Hambantota houses a large collection of parrots with an impressive showcase of some of the world’s most unique parrots. You can tell a parrot by its short, hooked bills and incurved mandibles (lower beak), as well as their finely scaled feet. On each foot, they have 2 toes pointing forward and 2 pointing backward. This gives them a better ability to grasp items and they are known for their exceptional ability to perform acrobatic acts as they perch on branches or even hang upside down. Their ability to mimic human voices and sounds has also endeared them to many and that is why, they are popular pets.
