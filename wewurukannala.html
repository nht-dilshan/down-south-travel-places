        Wewurukannala Raja Maha Viharaya is a significant Buddhist temple located in the town of Dikwella, in the southern province of Sri Lanka. It is renowned for its colossal Buddha statue and historical religious importance, making it a popular pilgrimage site and tourist attraction.
The main highlight of Wewurukannala Raja Maha Viharaya is the giant seated Buddha statue, which stands at an impressive height of approximately 160 feet (about 50 meters). This remarkable statue, known as the Wewurukannala Buddha, is one of the tallest Buddha statues in Sri Lanka and a striking sight to behold. Visitors can climb a series of narrow steps inside the statue, which leads to an observation platform near the Buddha's head, offering panoramic views of the surrounding area.
Apart from the towering Buddha statue, the temple complex itself boasts a rich history dating back several centuries. The architecture of the temple showcases a blend of traditional Sri Lankan and South Indian styles, reflecting the cultural influences that have shaped the region over time.

        Inside the temple, you'll find intricately painted frescoes and murals depicting scenes from Buddhist mythology and historical events. The main shrine houses a sacred relic, believed to be a sacred tooth relic of the Buddha. This relic is venerated by devout Buddhists who visit the temple to pay their respects and seek blessings.
        Another notable attraction within the temple complex is the "Wewurukannala Kataragama Devalaya," a separate building dedicated to the Hindu deity Lord Skanda (Murugan). This unique feature showcases the religious harmony and cultural diversity that exists in Sri Lanka.
        Visiting Wewurukannala Raja Maha Viharaya provides not only a spiritual experience but also an opportunity to immerse oneself in the rich cultural and historical heritage of Sri Lanka. The grandeur of the Buddha statue, the captivating murals, and the peaceful ambiance of the temple surroundings create a memorable and enlightening journey for travelers from all walks of life.
