        In Sri Lanka, names of villages, localities, and landmarks can sometimes be spelled or pronounced differently, leading to variations in the name. If "Fatna Deniyaya" is indeed a place in Sri Lanka, it might be spelled differently or be known by another name in official records or maps.
To get accurate and up-to-date information about "Fatna Deniyaya" or any other place in Sri Lanka, I recommend checking with official travel sources, maps, or local authorities. Additionally, conducting an online search using alternative spellings or variations of the name might help you find more information about the specific location you are interested in.
