        In 2004, the Paravi Duwa temple suffered extensive damage when the tsunami struck the coastal regions of Sri Lanka. The force of nature left the temple in ruins, devastating the local community. Recognizing the importance of this spiritual site, restoration endeavours were initiated to revive the temple's magnificence. With the support of devoted individuals, the temple has been meticulously reconstructed, breathing life back into its sacred halls. While the restoration aimed to preserve the temple's original architecture, some modifications were made to enhance its resilience against future natural disasters.

        Nestled on a beautiful island surrounded by the vast Indian Ocean, the Paravi Duwa temple offers a breathtaking setting. The tranquillity and natural beauty of the temple's surroundings create an aura of serenity, attracting people of all faiths. The island is connected to the mainland by a sturdy steel bridge (temporary ), allowing devotees and tourists easy access to the temple's hallowed grounds. In a significant turn of events, unfortunately, the wooden bridge that once connected Paravi Duwa to the mainland collapsed in 2022. For those who visit Pigeon Island and the Paravi Duwa temple, observing the remains of the old bridge can offer a glimpse into the past. The remnants tell a story of the bridge's former grandeur and its role in connecting people to the spiritual and cultural heart of the temple. As you approach the temple, the captivating view and the sound of crashing waves will transport you to a realm of peace and spirituality.
