        Considered to be one of the largest and most important Buddhist places of worship in the entire island, the Tissamaharama Raja Maha Viharaya is a temple that is hard to miss due to the gargantuan stupa that stands at a height of 156 feet, easily making it the largest temple in the southern region. The temple is believed to date back all the way to the 3rd century BC, during the reign of King Mahanaga of Ruhuna, shortly after Buddhism was established in the island. However, it was King Kavan Tissa that made the temple to its present state in the 2nd century BC.

        Ancient scripture also states that the very site the Tissamaharama Raja Maha Viharaya was consecrated by the Lord Buddha himself, during his third visit to the island, making it one of the holiest sites in the Buddhist world. Moreover, this ancient place of worship is surrounded by lush greenery, which makes it stand out from any other building in the area of Hambantota. History has shown that this temple is one of the few temples that was constantly restored by various kings of subsequent kingdoms, even after it was pillaged by invaders from India in the 13th century AD.
