        The Tallest Lighthouse in the Island Considered to be one of the more iconic lighthouses in the entire island, the Dondra Head Lighthouse serves to be the island’s tallest lighthouse, standing at a height of 160 feet. 
        <br>
        As it is located in the southernmost tip of Sri Lanka, it also serves to be one of the more important lighthouses still in operation. The lighthouse consists of 7 floors, which can be accessed by the 196-step stairway, which can be quite strenuous to the legs if you are to take the journey to the top. The view from the top is simply breathtaking, as it is possible to even the Bulutota Mountain Range if you look north. However, keep in mind that access to the top is only granted through special permission from the authorities.

        Interesting Facts <br>
        Since the lighthouse was built in the year 1890, during the occupation of the British Empire, the raw materials of the structure were all imported from the British mainland, especially from the granite rock quarries of Scotland and Wales. Moreover, the lenses and light that is used to power the lighthouse can be traced to some of the finest makers during the reign of the British Empire. Thus, the lighthouse is also a great example of the colonial heritage that is very much alive in the southern coast of the island.

        A Unique Design <br>
        Believed to have been built by the Dutch in 1775, right after the construction of the Star Fort, the Old Dutch Trade Centre, also known as the Nupe Market is one of the many overlooked vestiges of the colonial era that narrate an everlasting story of how Matara was a centre for trade and commercial activity between colonial powerhouses, and other nations. The building is built in a distinctive ‘T’ shape which is perfectly symmetrical, further reflecting the neo-palladian style used in the construction of the commercial structure. However, the roof of the building showcases a more local twist, as the tiles and the style used to construct the roof stems from the Kandyan Kingdom.
